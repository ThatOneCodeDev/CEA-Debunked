# CEAMisc Class
## GenerateKey()
This function generates a 32-character key using a combination of string.ascii_letters and string.digits modules.

### Security Vulnerability:

The generated key is not cryptographically secure and is susceptible to brute force attacks. A secure random number generator should be used instead.
## XOR(ptext, key)
This function takes two arguments, ptext and key, and performs an XOR operation on their corresponding characters. The result is a new string.

### Security Vulnerability:

XOR encryption can be easily broken if the key is known or can be guessed, as it does not provide strong encryption.
CipherEncode(plaintext)
This function takes a plaintext string as input and applies a simple substitution cipher to produce an encoded text.

### Security Vulnerability:

Substitution ciphers are easily broken using frequency analysis or other simple cryptanalysis techniques. They are not considered secure.

## CipherDecode(encodedtext)
This function takes an encoded text string as input and decodes it using the reverse substitution cipher applied in CipherEncode.

### Security Vulnerability:

As with CipherEncode, substitution ciphers are easily broken and are not considered secure.

# CEAEncrypt Class
## CEA256(plain_text)
This function takes a plaintext string and performs the following operations:

Applies a simple substitution cipher (using CipherEncode).
Converts the text into a series of decimal values.
Multiplies each decimal value by the sum of the decimal values of the key.
Applies an XOR operation to obfuscate the result.
Security Vulnerability:

The encryption method is not secure and is vulnerable to brute force attacks, frequency analysis attacks, and known-plaintext attacks.
# CEADecrypt Class
## CEA256(encoded_text)
This function takes an encoded text string and performs the reverse operations applied in CEAEncrypt.CEA256 to decrypt the text.

### Security Vulnerability:

The decryption method is not secure, as it relies on the same insecure encryption method used in CEAEncrypt.CEA256.
Overall Security Vulnerabilities
The CEA encryption library does not implement any form of authentication or message integrity checks, leaving the encrypted data susceptible to tampering and replay attacks.
