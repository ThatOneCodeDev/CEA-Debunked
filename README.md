# CEA256 Encryption Library Analysis

This repository contains an analysis of the CEA256 encryption library, with a focus on the version used in the deprecated CEAShimLTSB formerly used in Luna Selfbot. The goal of this analysis is to provide publicly available research into vulnerabilities exhibited by the algorithm, and to serve as a learning opportunity for those interested in cryptography. Analysis can be found via the analysis.md document.

## Repository Purpose
It is important to note that this repository is not intended to flame or criticize the creator of the CEA256 algorithm or any software that may have used it. Rather, the goal is to provide a detailed analysis of the algorithm's vulnerabilities and raise awareness of the need for strong encryption practices. It is our hope that this analysis will serve as a learning opportunity for developers and users alike, encouraging them to choose more secure encryption methods in their software and systems.

## About
The CEA256 encryption library is an outdated encryption algorithm that should not be used in modern cryptography applications. The library is vulnerable to several attacks, including brute force attacks, frequency analysis attacks, and known-plaintext attacks. The key generation method used in the library is not secure and can be easily reverse engineered by an attacker. Additionally, the CipherEncode() and CipherDecode() methods are not secure and utilize a simple substitution cipher that can be easily broken using frequency analysis or other simple cryptanalysis techniques.

It is highly recommended to replace the CEA encryption library with a more secure alternative such as TLS, AES, RSA, or XChaCha20. These algorithms provide much stronger encryption and security features, and are widely used in modern cryptography applications.

The analysis in this repository includes a breakdown of the CEA256 algorithm, a discussion of the vulnerabilities exhibited by the algorithm, and recommendations for more secure alternatives. This analysis is intended to serve as a learning resource for those interested in cryptography and to promote the use of secure encryption methods in software development.
